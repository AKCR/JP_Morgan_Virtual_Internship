# JP_Morgan_Virtual_Internship

The Virtual Internship at JP Morgan was exceptional. 

This is the summary of my tasks:

### Task 1:
So for the first task, I was asked to build an Interface with a stock price data feed. Firstly, I was simply asked to identify under valued or over valued stocks with the help of a program in python.

Subtasks within this task:
1. getDataPoint function to return correct tuple of stock name, bid_price, ask_price and price. Note: price of a stock = average of bid and ask
2. getRatio function to return the ratio of the two stock prices
3. main function to output correct stock info, prices and ratio
4. Upload a git patch file as the submission to this task
5. All unit tests inside client_test.py, added/existing have to pass

### Task 2:
Using Reactjs, we were asked to use the frameworks and tools in order to implement data visualization. Even though the interface was taken care of, we were asked to modify the functions in such a way that the data can be represented in the form of a graph instead of the tabular format which was given earlier

Subtasks within this task:
1. Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.
2. Fix the broken typescript files in repository to make the web application output correctly
3. Generate a patch file of the changes you made.

### Task 3:
Using Reactjs, we were asked to write up functions and edit the component files and the App.js files in such a way that the threat level of a stock is defined and along with that, it is marked whenever the threat level is met for two updations in a row.

Subtasks within this task:
1. This ticket is done when the numbers from the python script render properly in the live perspective graph. This means the ratio between the two stock prices is tracked and displayed. The upper and lower bounds must be shown on the graph too. And finally, alerts are shown whenever these bounds are crossed by the ratio (the guide below will also give more detail and visuals to help you understand these requirements better)
2. This ticket is done when a patch file is uploaded along with a video or audio explanation of the final chart you have produced
